# AndroidNativeEmu

Allows you to partly emulate an Android native library.

This is an educational project to learn more about the ELF file format and [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn).

[中文README](README_cn.md)

## Installation

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Python3WebSpider/AndroidNativeEmu.git@master
```

## Features

- Emulation of the [JNI Invocation API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html) so `JNI_OnLoad` can be called properly.
- Emulation of native memory for malloc / memcpy.
- Emulation of syscalls (SVC #0) instruction.
- Hooking through the symbol table.
- All JavaVM, JNIEnv and hooked functions are handled by python.
- Enable VFP support.

## Usage

> In the future this will be possible through pypi.

Make sure you are using python 3.7.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python example.py`

> If you have trouble getting the `keystone-engine` dependency on Windows (as I did):
> 1. Clone their [repository](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone)
> 2. Open a terminal in `bindings/python`
> 3. Run `python setup.py install` (Make sure you are using python 3.7)
> 4. Download their `Windows - Core engine` package [here](http://www.keystone-engine.org/download/) for your python arch.
> 5. Put the `keystone.dll` in `C:\location_to_python\Lib\site-packages\keystone\`.

## TODO

- Improve file descriptors in `vfs/file_system.py` so they are re-useable.
- Add a way for the VirtualFileSystem to give back dynamic files, such as `/proc/self/status`, `/proc/self/status` but also `/dev/urandom`.
- Library consumers must be able to easily rebuild the needed Java classes for a native library, which are used by the native library through the JNIEnv.
